# Azure App Configuration - Go Provider

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration-GoProvider/azureappconfiguration)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration-GoProvider/azureappconfiguration)

## Overview

[Azure App Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides centralized configuration storage and management, allowing users to update their configurations without the need to rebuild and redeploy their applications. The App Configuration provider for Go is built on top of the [Azure Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/data/azappconfig) and is designed to simplify data consumption in App Configuration with rich features. Users can consume App Configuration key-values as strongly-typed structs with data binding or load them into popular third-party configuration libraries, minimizing code changes. The Go provider offers features such as configuration composition from multiple labels, key prefix trimming, automatic resolution of Key Vault references, feature flags, failover with geo-replication for enhanced reliability, and many more.
